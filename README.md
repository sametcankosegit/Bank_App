# bank_app_v1

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Hello everyone, I am sharing my app with you again, which I am still developing. I have designed login and signup page layouts, a home page, and a few in-app pages. Normally, in my app, Firebase will handle the Auth processes, but I haven't added them to the app's code yet due to some Firebase-related issues. However, the Firebase code is ready and waiting; I will add it as soon as possible.

Speaking of our application, it is a banking app. In this app, I am planning to add features such as money transfers, currency operations, and many other functionalities. Please stay tuned. Best regards.
